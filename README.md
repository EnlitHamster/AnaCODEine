# Project CODEine

This repository is part of project CODEine, a number of languages based on TRAP music slang that gets implemented in different puyre language paradigms. 

## AnaCODEine

This language is based on the Python3 grammar and uses a word game as a name, mixing Anaconda, a different similar snake to Pythons, and CODEine, the base language on which this is based. For the base grammar for the lexer and parser, refer to the [example Python3 grammar](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/python/python3) from the Antlr repository.
